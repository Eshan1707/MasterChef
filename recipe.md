Step 1
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.

Step 2
Mix chicken and 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce together in a bowl until evenly coated.

Step 3
Roll dough onto a work surface and cut in half to form 2 rectangles. Brush the top of each rectangle with olive oil.

Step 4
Place dough, oil-side down, onto the grill; cook until bottom of dough is browned and top is bubbling up, about 5 minutes. Brush the tops of each dough with oil and flip.

Step 5
Spread the remaining barbeque sauce over each crust; top with chicken, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and tomatoes.

Step 6
Close the lid of the grill and cook pizza until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pizza from grill and cool before slicing, 2 to 3 minutes.
